# core/meta/deprecation (deprecated)

This module provides a bunch of functions and decorators for marking deprecated functions with the special flag. Please notice, that this module is deprecated and will be removed from the next major release of the library. You can use modules from [core/functools/deprecation](src_core_functools_deprecation_index.html) instead of this.
